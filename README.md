# CodingQuiz
JavaScript-based quiz application
## About and Functionality
CodingQuiz is a JavaScript-based application that runs through a series of questions about, in this case, the history of JavaScript and some basic element of how it can be used. It can be accessed here: https://preussenfahrer.github.io/CodingQuiz/.  The application is styled via Bootstrap and Bootswatch, it also is timed at 75 seconds. The user is first presented with the parameters of the quiz, outlining the rules. After clicking on the "Start the Quiz" button, the user is then taken through a series of questions, where they can click the answer that they believe to be correct. Unfortunately, at the current stage, the parameters for correct and incorrect answers are not yet set. Shortly, these will be updated in the application. At the present moment, the user, when selecting a correct answer, will proceed to the next question. The ability to add high scores and see progress, in addition to receiving penalties for incorrectly answering questions, are set to be added soon.

## Screenshots
